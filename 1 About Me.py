    st.write("Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've cultivated a strong foundation in software engineering. This background has equipped me with a solid understanding of how to develop robust applications. However, my passion for learning and tackling new challenges has led me to cybersecurity, where I'm eager to learn how to create secure systems and defend against threats.")
    st.write("Although I'm still figuring out what field of cybersecurity I'd like to focus on, I'm particularly interested in a DevSecOps role, which I believe perfectly combines my software development skills with the security skills I'm acquiring. This role aligns with my goal of integrating security practices into the development process to build resilient and secure applications.")

Developed a slackbot in Python that accessed several API's and databases to report monitoring statistics.")
