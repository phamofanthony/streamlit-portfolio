Previously, the process required numerous different portals for all the parties, presentations from the instructor, lengthy forms to fill out for students, and tens of hours of work from instructors. This web app combined all those processes into one portal, automating many of the former manual processes and allowing all the parties a straightforawrd view of what's relevant to them.")
